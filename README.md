## What is Autocross (AutoX)?
Autocross is a timed competition in which drivers navigate one at a time through a defined course on either a sealed or an unsealed surface. It is a form of motorsports that emphasizes safe competition and active participation. ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocross))

## What the hell is this app?
This app is to help new autocrossers get a feel for learning an autocross course. Autocross uses a coned course, so for a newbie it might be hard to remember the layout. Drivers are allowed to walk the course before driving around it, so this app is meant to be ran during this walkthrough. When standing on the starting line, press the "Start Tracking" button. Walk the course. When you reach the finish line, press "Stop Tracking". Your autocross course is now saved within the app. 

Mount your device in your car and pull up the map of the course you just made. You will see yourself on the map and will be able to follow the line that is overlaid on the map. You can also time your laps when on this screen by pressing the "Start Timing" button.

Voil√†!
